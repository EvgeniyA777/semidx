# Working Note: Shorthand Retrieval Implementation Log On 2026-04-03

## Summary

Completed the planned shorthand retrieval improvement work in staged commits on `dev` and pushed all stages to `origin/dev`.

The implemented scope covered:

- shorthand anchor inference
- lexical candidate hygiene against vendored noise
- `suspected_symbols` scoring
- more conservative continuation guidance for ambiguous low-evidence retrieval
- runtime and MCP regression coverage
- retrieval benchmark fixtures for shorthand scenarios

## Commits

### Stage 1: foundation slice

- `5a4d5db` `Improve shorthand retrieval anchoring and hygiene`
- `b2358ce` `Refresh code context summary`

### Stage 2: benchmark and fixture coverage

- `8656a87` `Add shorthand retrieval benchmark fixtures`
- `596e186` `Refresh code context summary`

## Files Changed

### Core implementation

- `src/semidx/runtime/query_anchors.clj`
- `src/semidx/mcp/core.clj`
- `src/semidx/runtime/retrieval.clj`
- `src/semidx/runtime/retrieval_policy.clj`

### Tests

- `test/semidx/runtime_test.clj`
- `test/semidx/mcp_server_test.clj`
- `test/semidx/mcp_http_server_test.clj`

### Benchmark coverage

- `src/semidx/runtime/benchmarks.clj`
- `fixtures/retrieval/corpus.json`
- `fixtures/retrieval/shorthand-vendored-noise.json`
- `fixtures/retrieval/shorthand-suspected-symbols-recovery.json`

## Implemented Behavior

### 1. Shorthand query enrichment

Added a dedicated helper namespace for lightweight shorthand anchor inference:

- infer likely symbol-like candidates
- infer module-like candidates
- infer path-like preferences

This enrichment is now applied during MCP shorthand normalization instead of relying on the old fake-default structural anchor.

### 2. Safer shorthand fallback target

When shorthand input does not already contain explicit targets, normalization now falls back through:

- `:targets {:diff_summary ...}`

instead of:

- `:targets {:paths ["."]}`

This keeps the query valid without pretending that `"."` is a real structural path target.

### 3. Lexical hygiene

Retrieval now classifies paths and prevents broad lexical seeding from treating all files equally.

The implementation now avoids or deprioritizes lexical seeds from:

- vendored paths
- fixture paths
- generated paths

This directly addresses the observed drift into `.tree-sitter-grammars/...`.

### 4. `suspected_symbols` is now live

The MCP schema already exposed `suspected_symbols`, but retrieval previously ignored it.

The implementation now adds real scoring support for:

- exact symbol-hint matches
- partial symbol-segment matches

These hints remain bounded and do not masquerade as exact target resolution.

### 5. More honest continuation guidance

For low-evidence broad queries with:

- no tier1 evidence
- ambiguous top ranks
- no explicit structural targets

the selection guidance now prefers a narrowing-oriented next step instead of pretending the current selection is already strong enough.

## Verification

### Passed

- `runtime_test + mcp_server_test`
  - `108 tests`
  - `606 assertions`
  - `0 failures`
  - `0 errors`

- `clojure -M:bench --fixture-prefix retrieval_shorthand_`
  - `2` fixtures
  - `2` passed

### Environment-limited

`mcp_http_server_test` could not be fully exercised end-to-end in this environment because local HTTP server bind failed with:

- `Operation not permitted`

This appeared to be an execution-environment restriction rather than an application-level regression. The test namespace itself still loaded successfully.

## Practical Outcome

The repo now has:

- a cleaner shorthand retrieval ingress path
- better resistance to vendored lexical contamination
- a real use of symbol hints already present in the public schema
- regression tests and benchmark fixtures that lock the new shorthand behavior

## Repository State At Close

- branch: `dev`
- remote push: completed
- git worktree: clean
