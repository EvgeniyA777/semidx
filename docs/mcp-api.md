# MCP API

`Semantic Code Indexing` can run as a local MCP server over the same core library API via:

- stdio
- Streamable HTTP
- legacy-style SSE (`GET /mcp/sse` + `POST /mcp/messages`)

## Start

```bash
SCI_MCP_ALLOWED_ROOTS="<repo-a-root>:<repo-b-root>" \
clojure -M:mcp

SCI_MCP_ALLOWED_ROOTS="<repo-a-root>:<repo-b-root>" \
clojure -M:mcp-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8791 --transport-mode dual
```

Environment and flags:

- `SCI_MCP_ALLOWED_ROOTS` - optional allowlist of canonical repository roots; use the platform path separator (`:` on macOS/Linux, `;` on Windows)
- `SCI_MCP_MAX_INDEXES` - optional in-memory LRU cache size; default `8`
- `SCI_MCP_POLICY_REGISTRY_FILE` - optional EDN policy registry file used for active-policy defaults and selector-based `resolve_context` lookup
- `SCI_USAGE_METRICS_JDBC_URL` - optional PostgreSQL JDBC URL for MCP usage metrics
- `SCI_USAGE_METRICS_DB_USER` - optional PostgreSQL username for MCP usage metrics
- `SCI_USAGE_METRICS_DB_PASSWORD` - optional PostgreSQL password for MCP usage metrics
- `--host` / `--port` - only for `clojure -M:mcp-http`; defaults `127.0.0.1:8791`
- `--transport-mode dual|streamable|sse` - only for `clojure -M:mcp-http`; default `dual`

If `SCI_MCP_ALLOWED_ROOTS` is missing, the server defaults the allowlist to the current working directory of the MCP process and prints a warning with:

- the current working directory seen by the JVM
- an example command that makes that directory explicit
- an example command that uses an explicit custom path

The server does not prompt interactively for this choice because `stdin`/`stdout` are reserved for MCP transport.

The MCP server exposes only `tools` capability in v1 and keeps cached indexes in-process for the lifetime of the server/session.

`stdio` stays session-scoped to the local process. `mcp-http` adds in-memory sessions with:

- `Mcp-Session-Id` for Streamable HTTP after `initialize`
- one active SSE stream per session
- lazy in-memory session cleanup after 30 minutes of inactivity
- no persistent session store and no built-in authn/authz in v1
- transport-level session errors for missing/expired sessions instead of silent implicit recreation outside `initialize`

The HTTP MCP transport is local-only by default because `mcp-http` binds to `127.0.0.1` unless overridden explicitly.

## Agent Onboarding

If you want an IDE or coding agent to use this server correctly on the first pass, do not rely on a generic “use the MCP if helpful” instruction. Use an explicit `MCP-first` prompt that says:

1. call `create_index` first
2. call `repo_map` immediately after indexing
3. use `resolve_context -> expand_context -> fetch_context_detail` for code-understanding work
4. treat `language_refresh_required` as “rerun create_index”
5. treat `language_activation_in_progress` as “wait and retry the same request”
6. only fall back to manual file inspection after the MCP failure has been surfaced explicitly

Canonical English prompt snippets for Codex, Claude-style IDE agents, and generic MCP-capable IDE fields live in [docs/mcp-agent-prompts.md](mcp-agent-prompts.md).

## Transport Shapes

### Streamable HTTP

- `POST /mcp`
- `GET /health`

Flow:

1. `initialize` without `Mcp-Session-Id` creates a session and returns the same JSON-RPC result shape as stdio plus the `Mcp-Session-Id` response header.
2. Subsequent JSON-RPC calls reuse that session via `Mcp-Session-Id`.
3. Missing sessions return `missing_session`; expired or unknown sessions return `unknown_session`.
4. Tool-level errors still come back inside the normal MCP `tools/call` result payload.

### SSE

- `GET /mcp/sse`
- `POST /mcp/messages?session_id=<id>`

Flow:

1. `GET /mcp/sse` creates or reconnects an SSE session and immediately emits an `endpoint` event containing `session_id` and the canonical message POST endpoint.
2. Client posts JSON-RPC requests to `/mcp/messages`.
3. Responses are emitted back on the SSE stream as `event: message`.
4. Reconnecting the same session replaces the previous SSE stream.
5. Posting to `/mcp/messages` without an active SSE stream returns `sse_session_not_connected`.

Both HTTP transports reuse the same tool/session core as stdio, so `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call` return the same structured MCP payloads across transports.

If `SCI_USAGE_METRICS_JDBC_URL` is configured, the server records:

- tool usage events by operation (`create_index`, `repo_map`, `resolve_context`, `expand_context`, `fetch_context_detail`, `impact_analysis`, `skeletons`)
- cache-hit/cache-miss behavior for `create_index`
- cache eviction events
- normalized correlation fields such as `session_id`, `task_id`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, and `actor_id` where available

Those MCP usage events now align with the same normalized event shape used by the library and service edges, so downstream reporting can aggregate `library`, `http`, `grpc`, and `mcp` surfaces without custom per-surface adapters.

That same normalized event shape now also feeds Phase 5 replay harvesting, calibration reporting, and weekly review artifacts, so MCP-originated `resolve_context` traces can contribute to automatically generated replay datasets and linked review summaries when query snapshots and feedback are present.

If `SCI_MCP_POLICY_REGISTRY_FILE` is configured, newly created cached indexes inherit that registry and `resolve_context` accepts an optional `retrieval_policy` object for selector-based lookup.

## Recommended Client Description

If your MCP client supports a per-server `description` field in its local config, use wording like this so AI clients route code-navigation and code-retrieval tasks here more reliably:

```json
"description": "Local MCP server for repository-aware code retrieval and codebase navigation. Use it to index a repository, build a compact repo map, find the most relevant files, functions, and symbols for a task, estimate change impact, and return lightweight code skeletons instead of loading full files. Best for large multi-file codebases when the agent needs precise context with lower token cost. Structure-aware and symbol/call-graph-guided; not a full compiler-grade semantic analyzer."
```

Shorter version for clients with tight field limits:

```json
"description": "Repository-aware code retrieval MCP: index a repo, generate repo maps, find relevant symbols and files, run impact analysis, and fetch code skeletons with low token cost."
```

Minimal onboarding snippet for clients that support only a short instruction field:

```text
Use semantic-code-indexing in MCP-first mode: call create_index, then repo_map, then use resolve_context -> expand_context -> fetch_context_detail. Treat language_refresh_required as rerun-create_index, language_activation_in_progress as wait-and-retry, and only fall back to manual repo inspection after you report the MCP failure explicitly.
```

## Tools

Canonical MCP retrieval flow is:

1. `create_index`
2. `resolve_context`
3. optional `expand_context`
4. optional `fetch_context_detail`

`resolve_context` returns a compact selection artifact. Rich retrieval detail is intentionally delayed to `fetch_context_detail`.

### `create_index`

Index a repository root or reuse a cached index. Agents should usually call this first.

Inputs:

- `root_path` - repository root to index
- `paths` - optional relative subset of source paths
- `parser_opts` - optional parser configuration map
- `language_policy` - optional activation policy map with `allow_languages`, `disable_languages`, and `prewarm_languages`
- `force_rebuild` - optional boolean; when `true`, bypasses cache reuse

Returns:

- `index_id` - session-scoped handle for later calls
- `snapshot_id`
- `indexed_at`
- `index_lifecycle`
- `root_path`
- `file_count`
- `unit_count`
- `cache_hit`
- `detected_languages`
- `active_languages`
- `language_fingerprint`
- `activation_state`
- `selection_hint`

`index_lifecycle` exposes the current snapshot reuse/provenance state for that handle, including whether it was rebuilt, reused, pinned, or considered stale.

Language activation behavior for MCP:

- `create_index` runs a cheap supported-language discovery pass before indexing
- that discovery pass shares the same ignored shadow roots as the main indexer: `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `venv`, `target`, `dist`, and `build`
- if no supported source language is detected, the tool returns `no_supported_languages_found` with structured guidance so the client can ask the user for a core language
- empty or early-stage repos can be bootstrapped explicitly with `language_policy.allow_languages`, for example `{ "allow_languages": ["python"] }`
- later retrieval requests do not auto-activate newly added supported languages; the client must call `create_index` again to refresh activation

### `repo_map`

Return a compact repository map for high-level codebase navigation without loading full source files.

Inputs:

- `index_id`
- `max_files`
- `max_modules`

Returns the existing runtime `repo-map` payload plus `index_id`.

### `resolve_context`

Find the most relevant files and symbols for a coding task or question and return a compact staged selection.

Inputs:

- `index_id`
- `query`
- `retrieval_policy` - optional registry-backed selector object such as `{ "policy_id": "...", "version": "..." }`

Returns:

- `index_id`
- `api_version`
- `selection_id`
- `snapshot_id`
- `result_status`
- `confidence_level`
- `budget_summary`
- `focus`
- `next_step`
- `project_context`

`next_step` tells the client whether it should stay compact, expand the structural view, or fetch rich detail.

Because MCP uses the same core retrieval runtime as the library and service edges, recent semantic-core improvements still flow through `resolve_context` here:

- Clojure: stronger namespace/test linkage, multimethod targeting, literal dispatch-specific `defmethod` caller resolution, first-class `defprotocol` method surfaces, macro-generated ownership across helper/composed/threaded expansion patterns, lexical local-binding suppression for same-name var collisions, and conservative branch-sensitive handling for conflicting generated forms
- Elixir: better `import` / `use` normalization, implicit imports propagated from `__using__/1`, pipeline/capture-aware arity handling, `__MODULE__` and nested local-module ownership, arity-aware local shadowing, `defdelegate` linkage, and ExUnit `related_tests`
- Java: arity-aware overload and constructor linking, better static-import/class ownership, inherited superclass targeting, local `this.` / `super.` ownership preservation, and `super::method` reference linkage
- Python: imported-symbol, relative-import, and module-alias resolution, `self` / `cls` and decorated class/static method ownership, explicit module-alias preservation, nested local-scope suppression, conservative `@property` access, and Python test-file linkage
- TypeScript: named/default/namespace import ownership, local `this.` and class-qualified method targeting, exported function-expression identity, object-literal and class-field-arrow units, plus direct default/re-export alias surfaces, while confidence remains `low`-ceiling because the parser path is still intentionally conservative

Because the capability summary is now language-strength-aware, MCP `resolve_context` responses may also carry a capability-limited confidence outcome even when symbol resolution is exact. Today that effectively means Clojure can reach `high`, Elixir/Java/Python currently ceiling at `medium`, and TypeScript remains intentionally `low`-ceiling even after the newer object/class-field/default-alias surfaces.

### `expand_context`

Expand a retained selection artifact with bounded structural detail.

Inputs:

- `index_id`
- `selection_id`
- `snapshot_id`
- `unit_ids` - optional subset of the selected units
- `include_impact_hints` - optional boolean, defaults to `true`

Returns:

- `index_id`
- `api_version`
- `selection_id`
- `snapshot_id`
- `result_status`
- `budget_summary`
- `skeletons`
- optional `impact_hints`
- `project_context`

### `fetch_context_detail`

Fetch the rich detail payload for a retained selection artifact.

Inputs:

- `index_id`
- `selection_id`
- `snapshot_id`
- `unit_ids` - optional subset of the selected units
- `detail_level` - optional raw-code escalation bound

Returns:

- `index_id`
- `api_version`
- `selection_id`
- `snapshot_id`
- `raw_context`
- `context_packet`
- `guardrail_assessment`
- `diagnostics_trace`
- `stage_events`
- `project_context`

The returned `context_packet` and `diagnostics_trace` include:

- `retrieval_policy` - versioned ranking policy summary used for this retrieval
- `capabilities` - parser/language coverage summary for the selected authority/support evidence set, including per-language strength and a derived `confidence_ceiling`

### `impact_analysis`

Estimate what is likely to be affected by a proposed change, bug fix, refactor, or target query.

Inputs:

- `index_id`
- `query`

Returns:

- `index_id`
- `impact_hints`

### `skeletons`

Return lightweight code skeletons for selected files or semantic units so an agent can inspect structure before loading raw code.

Inputs:

- `index_id`
- `paths` or `unit_ids`

Returns:

- `index_id`
- `skeletons`

## Operational Notes

- Every `root_path` must be inside `SCI_MCP_ALLOWED_ROOTS`.
- `paths` must be relative and must not contain traversal segments such as `..`.
- Cached indexes are evicted by LRU when the process exceeds `SCI_MCP_MAX_INDEXES`.
- If an `index_id` is evicted or unknown, the server returns an `index_not_found` tool error and the client should call `create_index` again.
- `selection_id` artifacts are snapshot-bound. Reusing a selection with the wrong `snapshot_id` returns `snapshot_mismatch`.
- If a retained selection artifact is missing or evicted, the server returns `selection_not_found` or `selection_evicted`.
- `resolve_context` defaults missing `api_version` to `"1.0"` and rejects unsupported values with `unsupported_api_version`.
- MCP tool errors now carry canonical taxonomy fields in `structuredContent.details`: `code` and `category`.
- `no_supported_languages_found` errors also carry `supported_languages`, `selection_hint`, and optional `recommended_core_language` in `structuredContent.details.details`.
- `language_refresh_required` indicates that the request references a supported language outside the current active lane set; the client should rerun `create_index`.
- Streamable HTTP session bootstrap is explicit: only `initialize` creates a new session. Other methods must reuse `Mcp-Session-Id`.
- SSE sessions also expire after inactivity; clients should reconnect and reinitialize if they receive `unknown_session`.
