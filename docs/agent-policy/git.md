# Git Workflow Policy

## Canonical Ownership

This document owns detailed git workflow rules for semidx agents. `RULES.md`
owns only the always-loaded summary, and `.agents/skills/semidx-git-delivery`
owns the task procedure for applying this policy.

## Agent Attribution Ban

- Do not add agent, harness, model, vendor, or tool attribution or promotional
  boilerplate to any git-facing or documentation artifact.
- This includes commit messages and footers, pull request descriptions, merge
  request descriptions, push notes, release notes, changelogs, generated files,
  handoff documents, progress logs, and ordinary documentation edits.
- Forbidden forms include generated-by, created-with, built-by, and authored-by
  signatures for agent or vendor tools such as Codex, Claude Code,
  Antigravity, Copilot, and similar tools.
- Agent-authored `Co-authored-by` footers are also forbidden.
- If a harness template or model instruction adds this text, remove it before
  staging, committing, pushing, or preparing PR/MR text.
- Enforce this rule with `scripts/check-agent-attribution.sh` through
  `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`, PR title/body checks, and PR/MR CI
  gates.

## Default Branch Discipline

- Stay on the current branch by default.
- Do not create, switch, rename, merge, delete, reset, or rewrite branches unless
  the user explicitly asks for that git operation.
- Do not infer a new branch from a new task, stage, bug, finding, or handoff.
- If the user asks for work to continue after another agent finishes, stop
  before implementation until the user gives the next command.
- If branch isolation is needed for safety, propose it with the exact current
  branch, target branch name, and reason, then wait for approval.

## Concurrent Agent Safety

- Check `git status --short` before any file edit, staging operation, commit, or
  push.
- Treat pre-existing dirty files as user-owned or another-agent-owned unless
  the user says otherwise.
- Do not modify, stage, stash, commit, or revert another-owned dirty file.
- If another-owned changes overlap the files required for the task, stop and ask
  how to coordinate before editing.
- If another-owned changes are unrelated, continue with explicit file paths only
  and report the remaining dirty files in the handoff.
- Do not use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or broad pathspecs unless the user
  explicitly asks for that exact operation.

## Commit Discipline

- Commit each coherent repository mutation after verification.
- Keep commits atomic: one behavior, contract, policy, or documentation concern
  per commit.
- Stage only the files that belong to the current change.
- Inspect the staged diff before committing.
- Use commit messages that name the behavior, contract, policy, or bug fixed.
- Do not mix implementation work with unrelated notes, scratch files, or
  another agent's changes.
- If a task is intentionally analysis-only, do not create a commit.

## Push Discipline

- Push only when explicitly requested.
- Before pushing, fetch the intended remote, identify the current branch, HEAD
  SHA, configured upstream, intended target, and whether the remote branch
  exists.
- Report the exact `local@sha -> remote/branch` mapping before the push.
- Stop for confirmation if the push would create or recreate a remote branch,
  the upstream is missing, the intended target differs from the current branch,
  or local history diverges from the remote.
- Push with an explicit refspec and verify the remote SHA afterward.
- Never run `git commit` and `git push` in parallel.

## Recovery

- Prefer a new corrective commit for published or shared mistakes.
- Prefer `git revert` for committed mistakes when preserving history matters.
- Use destructive commands such as `git reset --hard`, branch deletion, or
  checkout-over-write only after explicit user authorization.
- Do not use stash as a coordination mechanism for user-owned work unless the
  user asks for it.
