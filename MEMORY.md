# Project Memory

## Purpose

This file stores lightweight operational memory for the project:

- current implementation reality
- key non-ADR decisions
- active assumptions and constraints
- near-term next steps

Use this as a fast session bootstrap before deep-diving into ADRs and code.

## Current State

- Contract layer is established (`contracts/schemas`, `contracts/examples`, `fixtures/retrieval`).
- Clojure-side contract mirror is implemented with `malli`.
- MVP runtime is implemented with public API in `semantic-code-indexing.core`.
- Clojure parser path supports `clj-kondo` primary with regex fallback and optional tree-sitter extraction mode.
- Clojure fallback parsing now rewrites alias-qualified calls (`order/validate-order` -> `my.app.order/validate-order`), ignores nested defs inside wrapper forms such as `comment`, links test namespaces back to source namespaces for stronger `related_tests` hints including one helper-namespace hop inside `test/`, emits dispatch-aware `defmethod` unit identities, can rank the correct multimethod implementation from dispatch hints in the query text, and adds recursive graph-level inherited caller edges for custom macros across syntax-quote, list-built, local-helper-generated, top-level-helper-generated, and common composed expansions without leaking plain macro helper functions or unioning conflicting branch-only generated calls.
- Java parser path supports regex mode and optional tree-sitter extraction mode.
- Elixir/Python parser paths are regex-based with class/module-aware symbol and call normalization.
- TypeScript parser supports regex mode and optional tree-sitter extraction mode.
- Elixir parser now supports alias-aware call token expansion (`alias Foo.Bar, as: Baz` -> `Baz.fn()` -> `Foo.Bar.fn` token).
- Elixir extraction now distinguishes form operators (`def`, `defp`, `defmacro`, `defdelegate`) and uses `do/end` balancing for tighter unit boundaries.
- Elixir alias parsing now covers brace aliases and alias-chains (`alias Foo.{Bar,Baz}`, nested alias prefixes, `as:` single-target overrides).
- Elixir semantic-core now also expands unqualified imported calls toward imported modules, propagates implicit imports emitted by `__using__/1`, records per-function arity for same-name identities, prefers same-module local definitions over imported or `use`-expanded collisions with arity awareness, links `defdelegate` units to delegated targets, and surfaces ExUnit test-file linkage through `related_tests`.
- Java semantic-core now uses arity-aware overload resolution for caller/callee linking, handles static-import/class ownership more accurately when matching method calls, suppresses false same-name edges on qualified/static-import collisions, and keeps explicit `this.` / `super.` calls local to the caller class.
- Python semantic-core now expands imported symbols, relative imports, and module aliases toward owning modules, rewrites `self`/`cls` calls toward class-owned methods, preserves explicit module-alias ownership under same-name collisions, supports local class-qualified ownership (for example `OrderService.handle(...)`), and surfaces Python test-file linkage through `related_tests`.
- TypeScript semantic-core now expands named, namespace, and default-import ownership toward the right module targets, keeps `this.` and local class-qualified calls attached to their owning class methods, and emits first-class units for exported function-expression bindings in both runtime and onboarding coverage.
- Retrieval uses structural-first tiered scoring with non-compensating confidence ceilings.
- Raw-code escalation stage is implemented (opt-in, late, bounded by query constraints).
- Semantic resolution includes import-aware and owner-aware call target disambiguation.
- Optional persistence adapters exist: in-memory and PostgreSQL (snapshots + unit/call-edge projections + query API).
- Retrieval benchmark suite exists and is integrated into gates (`scripts/run-benchmarks.sh`).
- Retrieval fixtures/benchmarks now include multi-language ambiguity scenarios (Python, Java, Elixir).
- Retrieval fixtures/benchmarks now include TypeScript baseline and ambiguity onboarding scenarios.
- Postgres integration smoke exists in tests (enabled by `SCI_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`) and CI service job.
- Reproducible tree-sitter grammar bootstrap script exists (`scripts/setup-tree-sitter-grammars.sh`) with pinned grammar refs (Clojure/Java/TypeScript).
- CI runtime gates now install tree-sitter CLI + grammars before running tests.
- Minimal HTTP runtime edge exists (`clojure -M:runtime-http`) and boundary ADR is documented (`ADR-018`).
- HTTP boundary conformance tests exist and run in standard `clojure -M:test` gates (`semantic-code-indexing.runtime-http-test`).
- Minimal gRPC runtime edge exists (`clojure -M:runtime-grpc`) with parity tests in standard `clojure -M:test` gates (`semantic-code-indexing.runtime-grpc-test`).
- Service-mode policy boundary is documented in `ADR-019` and implemented as optional API-key + tenant gate on HTTP/gRPC edges.
- gRPC transport now uses dedicated runtime protobuf envelope messages defined in `proto/semantic_code_indexing/runtime/grpc/v1/runtime.proto`.
- Host-integrated authz policy contract is implemented on HTTP/gRPC edges via `:authz_check` callback and optional EDN policy adapter (`--authz-policy-file`, `ADR-021`).
- Language onboarding automation scripts now scaffold and validate adapter integration steps (`scripts/new-language-adapter.sh`, `scripts/validate-language-onboarding.sh`, `ADR-022`).
- Java method unit identities are signature/arity-sensitive (`...$arityN$sigXXXX`) to disambiguate overloads.
- Offline policy governance now supports registry lifecycle states (`draft`, `shadow`, `active`, `retired`), replay scorecards, side-by-side policy comparison, and promotion gates via `clojure -M:eval`.
- Replay datasets can now mark `protected_case` queries, and promotion gates reject candidate policies that introduce newly failed protected cases.
- Shadow-vs-active operational workflow now exists via `shadow-review`, which evaluates all `shadow` policies against the current `active` registry policy and can persist `:shadow_review` metadata back into the registry.
- Promotion governance now includes policy-level approval tiers and allow/block auto-promotion constraints, and direct `promote-policy` enforcement now requires explicit manual approval for `manual_approval_required` policies while still refusing `blocked` policies and replay-gate regressions.
- Capabilities are now language-strength-aware: retrieval emits `:selected_language_strengths` plus a derived `:confidence_ceiling`, final confidence is capped by that ceiling after raw-fetch upgrades, guardrails surface `capability_ceiling` signals, and governed replay scorecards include `confidence_ceiling_distribution`.
- Index lifecycle now emits `:index_lifecycle` metadata with TTL-aware stale detection, snapshot provenance, snapshot pinning on the library/storage path, and rebuild reasons; `resolve-context` surfaces stale snapshot state through capabilities and guardrails via `stale_index`.
- Error handling is now taxonomy-backed across library, HTTP, gRPC, and MCP: normalized `ExceptionInfo` ex-data carries `:error_code` / `:error_category`, HTTP responses emit the same fields, gRPC emits them in trailers (`x-sci-error-code`, `x-sci-error-category`), and MCP tool errors expose them in `structuredContent.details`.
- Clojure semantic-core now also traces macro-generated ownership through direct threading macros such as `->`, `->>`, `some->`, and `some->>` when they emit real call targets, while keeping ambiguous threaded branches conservative instead of over-linking both sides.
- Java semantic-core now also emits constructor units and resolves `new ClassName(...)` caller edges arity-sensitively, so constructor targeting is no longer collapsed into method-only matching.
- Elixir semantic-core now also expands `__MODULE__.foo(...)` to the owning local module, which closes another common collision path where imported or `use`-expanded helpers previously competed with explicit local-module qualification.
- Usage metrics now support SLO-facing rollups through `slo-report`, covering index latency, retrieval latency, cache hit ratio, degraded rate, fallback rate, and policy version distribution for both in-memory and PostgreSQL-backed sinks.
- HTTP/gRPC operational consistency is now tighter: both surfaces accept tenant/correlation metadata (`x-tenant-id`, `x-trace-id`, `x-request-id`, `x-session-id`, `x-task-id`, `x-actor-id`), feed that context into normalized usage events, and preserve correlation markers back to callers (`x-sci-*` headers for HTTP, `x-sci-*` trailers on gRPC errors).
- Phase 5 now includes a closed-loop governance cadence: `resolve_context` usage events retain query/outcome snapshots, `harvest-replay-dataset` can build replay corpora automatically from usage metrics plus structured feedback, difficult cases are promoted into harvested `protected_case` entries, `calibration-report` measures confidence calibration against real feedback outcomes, `weekly-review-report` emits linked `query -> selected context -> feedback -> outcome` artifacts, those review artifacts can be converted back into protected replay datasets for governance, `policy-review-pipeline` can bundle weekly review generation plus registry-backed `shadow-review`, `scheduled-policy-review` can persist timestamped review bundles with manifest-driven review windows and retention, `scheduled-governance-cycle` can retain promotion decisions, emit deterministic `candidate_ranking`, and auto-promote either a single eligible shadow policy or a best-ranked candidate when explicitly allowed, with optional history-aware selection plus `required_candidate_streak_runs` and `promotion_cooldown_runs`, and `governance-history-report` can summarize promoted/skipped trends across retained governance runs.
- `scheduled-policy-review` now also retains standalone `weekly-review-*`, `protected-replay-dataset-*`, and `shadow-review-*` artifacts alongside each bundle and records direct manifest pointers to the latest copies, so Phase 5 review outputs can be reused without reopening the aggregate bundle first.
- Phase 5 orchestration now also maintains retained review/governance indexes plus derived `phase5-review-queue` and `phase5-status-report` outputs, so operators can see pending review work and recent loop state without scanning raw retained artifacts by hand.
- Phase 5 now also has a top-level retained orchestration command, `scheduled-phase5-cycle`, which snapshots the current governance run, queue state, and aggregate status into one first-class artifact stream plus `phase5-run-index.json`.
- Canonical in-repo roadmap status checklist now lives in `docs/roadmap-status.md`, with a dated rationale and status snapshot stored under `notes/`.
- Product roadmap progress is now effectively through the main Phase 5 slices: governed quality loop, language-priority semantic-core deepening, capabilities/calibration, index lifecycle, unified error taxonomy, SLO-facing metrics, tenant/trace consistency, governance-tier enforcement, and retained self-improvement orchestration are in place; the next major tranche is post-roadmap deeper compiler-grade semantic follow-up.
- Active execution backlog is now tracked in `docs/post-roadmap-semantic-deepening-plan.md`; Stages 1-6 (Clojure lexical/destructuring, Clojure dispatch/protocol, Java inheritance/method-reference, Python decorator/class-scope, Elixir pipeline/nested-module, and TypeScript parser-strengthening) are delivered and Stage 7 is the active slice.

## Hard Invariants

- JSON Schema is the external contract source of truth.
- `malli` is a runtime mirror, not a competing source of truth.
- Outputs must remain bounded and contract-valid (`context_packet`, diagnostics, guardrails, events).
- If limits are exhausted, stop immediately and wait for explicit user instruction.
- Before any service-backed tests (PostgreSQL or other servers): detect running instance -> shutdown if running -> start fresh with required config -> only then run tests.

## Known Gaps

- No full compiler-grade interprocedural semantic resolution across all supported languages yet.
- gRPC message classes are still descriptor-built at runtime; generated Java/Kotlin stubs are not wired yet.
- No dynamic external policy backend integration yet (current authz adapter is local file/callback based).
- HTTP/gRPC/MCP surfaces now support server-configured registries and selector-based `resolve_context` policy lookup, but broader online policy-management/control-plane APIs are still intentionally absent.
- Rate limiting is delegated to ingress/proxy/host layer and not implemented in runtime edges.
- Tree-sitter path still depends on external CLI availability, though grammar bootstrap is now scripted and pinned.
- Persistence graph queries are retrieval-oriented and not yet a full semantic graph query language.
- Phase 3 roadmap closure is now complete across Clojure, Elixir, Java, Python, and TypeScript; remaining semantic work is post-roadmap deepening rather than an open roadmap tail.
- Clojure fallback/tree-sitter call extraction now suppresses false same-name global edges when calls are actually owned by local params, destructured bindings, `when-let` locals, comprehension bindings, `as->` locals, or `letfn` helper names.
- Clojure multimethod/protocol handling now also emits literal dispatch-aware call tokens for `defmulti`/`defmethod` targeting and first-class `defprotocol` method units, while keeping generic multimethod calls from over-linking every implementation.
- Java semantic-core now also carries direct superclass metadata plus method-reference call tokens, so resolver narrowing can keep `super.` calls, inherited unqualified subclass calls, lambda-owned inherited calls, and `super::method` references attached to the parent implementation instead of same-name overrides.
- Python semantic-core now also preserves decorated `@classmethod` / `@staticmethod` ownership while suppressing nested local def/class over-linking and keeping plain `@property` access conservative instead of turning attribute reads into synthetic call edges.
- Elixir semantic-core now also treats pipeline calls and local captures (`&normalize/1`) as arity-aware caller edges and has regression coverage for `__MODULE__.Nested.foo(...)` nested-module linkage without regressing local-vs-import precedence.
- TypeScript semantic-core now also emits object-literal methods, class field arrow methods, `export default foo` aliases, and direct re-export alias units in both runtime and onboarding coverage while still keeping the public confidence ceiling conservative.
- Runtime hardening is now effectively complete for the main roadmap scope; any remaining ops work is incremental polish rather than a missing Phase 4 primitive.
- Real self-improvement loop is now operationally complete for the current roadmap scope: replay harvesting, difficult-case capture, calibration reports, weekly review artifacts, protected replay dataset conversion, retained review/governance runs, queue/status reporting, and top-level retained Phase 5 orchestration all exist.
- Compact-first staged retrieval is now fully aligned as the canonical public flow: `resolve_context` is compact-first, `expand_context` / `fetch_context_detail` are the explicit later stages, selection artifacts are snapshot-bound, and the implementation/docs/examples line is captured by `ADR-024` plus the completed `docs/compact-first-staged-retrieval-plan.md`.

## Next Execution Priorities

1. Put the next serious engineering pass into genuinely deeper compiler-grade semantic-core work rather than more roadmap closure.
2. Keep tightening operational/docs alignment so roadmap, ADRs, examples, and runtime surfaces continue to describe the same canonical flow.
3. Treat further runtime/ops work as incremental polish unless a concrete production gap appears.
