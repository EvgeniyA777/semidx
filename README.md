# Semantic Code Indexing

Library-first architecture for structure-aware code retrieval and context packaging for AI development systems.

## Purpose

`Semantic Code Indexing` is a Clojure-first retrieval subsystem designed to be injected into larger AI orchestration systems as a library.

The project defines how a host system should request code context, how retrieval results should be packaged, and how confidence/guardrail signals should be emitted for safe downstream automation.

## What This Project Does

- defines external contracts for retrieval (`JSON Schema`)
- defines canonical request/response examples and diagnostics examples
- defines retrieval fixture corpus for behavior-based validation
- mirrors contracts in Clojure (`malli`) for runtime validation
- provides a local and CI gate to prevent contract drift

## What This Project Does Not Do (Yet)

- does not implement full repository indexing/parsing runtime yet
- does not implement ranking engine, graph storage, or parser adapters yet
- does not expose production API server endpoints yet

Current scope is contract architecture and validation infrastructure.

## Repository Layout

- `adr/` - architecture decisions (`ADR-001` .. `ADR-017`)
- `contracts/schemas/` - JSON Schema contracts (external source of truth)
- `contracts/examples/` - canonical examples for contract families
- `fixtures/retrieval/` - retrieval fixture corpus (behavior bands)
- `src/semantic_code_indexing/contracts/` - Clojure `malli` mirror and validator CLI
- `scripts/` - local validation entrypoints

## Contract Validation

- Local: `./scripts/validate-contracts.sh`
- CI: `.github/workflows/contracts-validation.yml`

## Current Contract Strategy

1. `JSON Schema` is the external contract source of truth.
2. `malli` is the Clojure-side runtime mirror.
3. `examples/fixtures` are shared verification artifacts across languages.

## Status

- contract layer established (`contracts/schemas`)
- canonical example set established (`contracts/examples`)
- seed fixture corpus established (`fixtures/retrieval`)
- Clojure validation gate implemented (`src/semantic_code_indexing/contracts`)
