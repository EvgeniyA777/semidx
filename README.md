# Semantic Code Indexing

Library-first architecture for structure-aware code retrieval and context packaging for AI development systems.

## Purpose

`Semantic Code Indexing` is a Clojure-first retrieval subsystem designed to be injected into larger AI orchestration systems as a library.

The project defines how a host system should request code context, how retrieval results should be packaged, and how confidence/guardrail signals should be emitted for safe downstream automation.

## What This Project Does

- defines external contracts for retrieval (`JSON Schema`)
- defines canonical request/response examples and diagnostics examples
- defines retrieval fixture corpus for behavior-based validation
- mirrors contracts in Clojure (`malli`) for runtime validation
- provides a local and CI gate to prevent contract drift
- provides a working in-memory MVP runtime for `create-index`, `update-index`, `repo-map`, `resolve-context`, `impact-analysis`, `skeletons`
- includes parser adapters for `Clojure + Java + Elixir + Python + TypeScript` and emits diagnostics/guardrails outputs
- supports optional persistence adapters (`in-memory`, `PostgreSQL`) with snapshot + graph projection storage for PostgreSQL
- includes retrieval benchmark suite aligned with fixture corpus (`ADR-014`)

## What This Project Does Not Do (Yet)

- does not implement production-grade deep semantic parsing (full compiler-level resolution)
- does not implement full compiler-grade interprocedural resolution across all languages
- does not expose production API server endpoints yet

Current scope is contract architecture plus a working MVP runtime implementation.

## Repository Layout

- `adr/` - architecture decisions (`ADR-001` .. `ADR-022`)
- `docs/` - runtime API and operational docs
- `contracts/schemas/` - JSON Schema contracts (external source of truth)
- `contracts/examples/` - canonical examples for contract families
- `fixtures/retrieval/` - retrieval fixture corpus (behavior bands)
- `src/semantic_code_indexing/contracts/` - Clojure `malli` mirror and validator CLI
- `scripts/` - local validation entrypoints

## Contract Validation

- Local: `./scripts/validate-contracts.sh`
- CI: `.github/workflows/contracts-validation.yml`

## Runtime Validation and Smoke

- Unit/integration tests: `clojure -M:test`
- Setup tree-sitter grammars (optional but reproducible; Clojure/Java/TypeScript): `./scripts/setup-tree-sitter-grammars.sh`
- Scaffold new language adapter onboarding: `./scripts/new-language-adapter.sh <language> --ext .ext1,.ext2`
- Validate language onboarding checklist and gates: `./scripts/validate-language-onboarding.sh <language>` (`--skip-gates` for fast checks)
- Retrieval benchmarks: `./scripts/run-benchmarks.sh`
- Resolve context from query file: `clojure -M:runtime --root . --query contracts/examples/queries/symbol-target.json --out /tmp/sci.json`
- Run minimal HTTP edge: `clojure -M:runtime-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787`
- Run minimal gRPC edge: `clojure -M:runtime-grpc --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8789`
- Optional service auth boundary flags: `--api-key <token> --require-tenant` (or env `SCI_RUNTIME_API_KEY`, `SCI_RUNTIME_REQUIRE_TENANT=true`)
- Optional host-integrated authz policy file: `--authz-policy-file /path/to/authz-policy.edn` (or env `SCI_RUNTIME_AUTHZ_POLICY_FILE`)
- gRPC edge currently uses typed protobuf `google.protobuf.Struct` payloads for unary methods.
- Full MVP gates: `./scripts/run-mvp-gates.sh`
- CI runtime gates: `.github/workflows/mvp-runtime.yml`
- Runtime API docs: [docs/runtime-api.md](docs/runtime-api.md)

## Agent Limit Policy

- If execution/model/tool limits are exhausted, the agent MUST stop work immediately.
- No retries, no fallback execution, no bypass attempts.
- The agent MUST send a short status message: `limit reached, waiting for user instruction`.
- After that message, the agent MUST wait for explicit user instruction before continuing.
- This local policy applies to this repository workflow.

## Service Restart Policy

- Before running integration tests that depend on services (PostgreSQL or any other local server), first check whether an instance is already running.
- If an instance is running, stop/shutdown it.
- Start a fresh instance with the required test configuration.
- Run tests only after the clean restart.

## Current Contract Strategy

1. `JSON Schema` is the external contract source of truth.
2. `malli` is the Clojure-side runtime mirror.
3. `examples/fixtures` are shared verification artifacts across languages.

## Status

- contract layer established (`contracts/schemas`)
- canonical example set established (`contracts/examples`)
- seed fixture corpus established (`fixtures/retrieval`)
- Clojure validation gate implemented (`src/semantic_code_indexing/contracts`)
- MVP runtime implemented (`src/semantic_code_indexing/core.clj`, `src/semantic_code_indexing/runtime/*`)
- Clojure retrieval uses `clj-kondo` as primary parser with fallback path
- Elixir, Python, and TypeScript retrieval paths are implemented in the same runtime adapter pipeline
- multi-language call/symbol resolution has module/class-aware normalization for Java, Elixir, Python, TypeScript
- import-aware and owner-aware disambiguation is applied when resolving ambiguous call targets
- optional tree-sitter extraction path is available for Clojure/Java (grammar-path configured)
- tiered structural-first ranking and non-compensating confidence model implemented
- late raw-code escalation stage is implemented and controlled by query options/constraints
- PostgreSQL persistence adapter stores snapshots plus unit/call-edge graph projections
- queryable graph access API is available via storage adapters (`query-units`, `query-callers`, `query-callees`)
- fixture-driven retrieval benchmarks are integrated into local and CI gates
- HTTP/gRPC edges now support tenant-aware host authz checks via pluggable `authz_check` contract or EDN policy file
