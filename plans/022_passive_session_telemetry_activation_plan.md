# Plan: Passive Session Telemetry Activation

Turns [`ideas/016`](../ideas/016_session_telemetry_value_measurement.md) from a
concept into staged work. That document stays the reasoning of record; this plan
owns the execution.

Relationship to the paused comparative track: `plans/020` remains paused and its
artefacts stay untouched. This plan does **not** resume it, does not build an
agent, and does not make a provider call. What it borrows from `plans/020` is
only already-delivered machinery (staged cost semantics, rollups, aggregation).

## Goal

Make semidx's own retrieval cost and outcome observable during real work, using
the machinery that already exists, and find out on data — not by assumption —
what is actually missing before building anything new.

## Why this shape

The measurement infrastructure is largely built and switched off. Verified in
the working tree on 2026-09-05:

| Capability | Where | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sink abstraction | `runtime/usage_metrics.clj`, `UsageMetricsSink` | exists |
| No-op / in-memory / PostgreSQL sinks | same namespace | exists |
| Default-off activation by env | `mcp/server.clj` builds a sink only when `SEMIDX_USAGE_METRICS_JDBC_URL` is set | exists |
| Failure isolation | `safe-record-event!` / `safe-record-feedback!` | exists |
| Event identity | `semantic_usage_events`: `session_id`, `task_id`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, `root_path_hash`, `confidence_level`, `result_status`, `latency_ms`, counts, `payload jsonb` | exists |
| Returned selection | `selected_unit_ids` / `selected_paths` in the payload (`core.clj`, `retrieval.clj`) | exists |
| Rollups, SLO, calibration, weekly review, replay harvest | `runtime/usage_metrics.clj` | exists |

So the first useful action is not to write code. It is to switch the existing
path on and look at what a real session actually produces.

## What semidx cannot measure, and what follows

semidx is an MCP server. It observes the tokens **it returned**, never what the
host model was billed: cache reads, cache writes, reasoning tokens, and priced
cost belong to the host session, not to this process.

Consequently a runtime event must not carry a `cost`, a cache split, or a
`price_schedule_id` as if semidx had measured them. Those fields are produced by
an **offline join** against the host transcript, which `ideas/016` measured to be
available and joinable for Claude Code sessions. Recording a number semidx did
not observe would be the same defect this repository has already recorded three
times in another form.

This also puts `SPEC.md` §5.1 in scope as an owner decision, not a task: its
North Star is stated as provider-priced task success per unit cost against a
preregistered baseline, which no observational record can produce on its own.

## Scope

In:

- activating the existing PostgreSQL usage sink on the interactive path;
- an inventory of what a real session actually writes;
- task identity, so events group into task attempts;
- one end-to-end offline join of a host transcript against semidx events;
- the surface gap found while planning (below).

Out:

- resuming `plans/020`, building an agent, or making any provider call;
- randomised A/B withholding (`ideas/016` describes it; it needs its own plan and
  a ground-truth decision);
- a value verdict of any kind — this plan produces distributions and a working
  join, never a pass/fail claim;
- the provider summary, which belongs to `plans/018` (see Stage 3);
- changing retrieval behaviour, ranking, or confidence.

## Verified gap found while planning

Five surfaces build a sink from `SEMIDX_USAGE_METRICS_JDBC_URL`:
`mcp/server.clj` (stdio), `runtime/http.clj`, `runtime/grpc.clj`, and the two
offline tools. **`mcp/http_server.clj` does not.** A host using the MCP
Streamable HTTP transport therefore produces no telemetry at all, silently. This
is a one-line-shaped gap, but it decides which sessions are observable, so it is
Stage 0 work rather than a footnote.

## Stages

### Stage 0. Activate and observe

Goal: find out what the existing path records during real work, before changing
anything.

Deliverables:

- A local PostgreSQL instance and the documented environment for enabling the
  sink, written down so a second machine can reproduce it.
- The MCP HTTP transport builds a sink like the other surfaces.
- One or more **real** working sessions run with the sink enabled.
- An inventory report under `reports/`: how many events, from which surfaces and
  operations, which identity fields were actually populated (especially
  `session_id` and `task_id`), what the `payload` contains, and what a
  `resolve_context` event looks like in full.
- An explicit privacy check: whether any payload carries prompt text or source
  code, and what is written by default.

Exit criteria:

- Events from a real session are present in `semantic_usage_events`.
- The inventory names, per field, whether it is populated, empty, or absent —
  measured, not assumed.
- The privacy check has an answer, and if raw text is recorded, that is a
  finding to fix before any wider collection.
- Nothing about retrieval behaviour changed.

Stop condition: if enabling the sink perturbs the interactive path in any
observable way — latency, errors, output — stop and report rather than tuning
around it.

Commit boundary: the MCP HTTP sink wiring, docs, and the inventory report.

### Stage 1a. Session identity and privacy hardening

Goal: make a session group, and stop the raw prompt reaching the database,
before any task-level work. Owner decision (2026-09-05): the two Stage 0
findings are an input gate to task identity, not a parallel concern — a task id
on top of an inconsistent session id would group events inside a session that
does not group.

Deliverables:

- **Session id precedence**: the server session id is the identity of the MCP
  session and wins outright; a trace refines identity and never erases it. A
  client `session_id` cannot replace it, and a request that supplies no trace no
  longer blanks fields the server already knows.
- **Query text redacted by default**: telemetry stores `details_hash` and
  `details_chars` instead of the user's words, keeping `purpose`,
  `target_keys`, and `token_budget`. Raw text only under
  `SEMIDX_USAGE_METRICS_CAPTURE_QUERY_TEXT=1`. The summary returned **to the
  caller** is untouched.
- Tests for the three precedence cases and for redaction, including one that
  proves the caller still sees its own normalized query.

Exit criteria:

- Every operation in one session carries the same session id, verified against a
  live database and not only in a unit test.
- No query text reaches the database with the default configuration.
- A client that supplies a full trace keeps `trace_id`, `request_id`, and
  `task_id`.

Commit boundary: identity and redaction only.

### Stage 1b. Task identity

Goal: make events group into task attempts, which is the unit of observation the
whole idea rests on.

Prerequisite: Stage 1a, so the grouping key underneath is consistent.

Deliverables:

- The declared task-boundary mechanism on the MCP path, per the owner decision
  recorded above: the host or a session wrapper supplies `task_id`, and an event
  without one is written as ungrouped. No runtime inference.
- Tests that events carry the identity, and that its absence degrades to
  ungrouped events rather than failing a request.
- **Delivered early (2026-09-06)**: a client `session_id` that loses the
  precedence contest is kept as `payload.client_session_id` instead of being
  discarded, because it is what an offline join against a host transcript keys
  on. Recorded only when it differs from the server's, so the common case gains
  no payload noise. Owner decision; verified on the live database.

Owner decision (2026-09-06): **session-scoped declaration through a dedicated
tool**, not `initialize` and not a per-call argument.

- `set_task_context {task_id}` writes the task onto the session state, and every
  later event inherits it, so `create_index` → `resolve_context` →
  `expand_context` → `fetch_context_detail` groups into one task attempt.
- Not `initialize`, because that is a transport handshake while one session can
  work through several tasks in sequence.
- Not a per-call argument, because `task_id` describes the working context
  rather than one retrieval, and repeating it on every tool would widen every
  schema.
- Precedence: a declared task wins; a `query.trace.task_id` that loses is kept
  as `payload.client_task_id`, so grouping never fragments; with no declared
  task the trace value still applies, keeping the existing contract working.
- Clearing is explicit — `set_task_context {task_id: null}`. A task never
  expires on its own.

Status: **complete (2026-09-06)**. Verified on the live database across a real
session: a declared task is inherited by the whole staged flow, a conflicting
trace task is preserved as evidence beside it, switching works, and after an
explicit clear the events are ungrouped again.

Exit criteria:

- Events from one real session group into task attempts.
- A session that sets nothing still works exactly as before.

Commit boundary: identity plumbing only; no aggregation, no verdict.

### Stage 2. Offline join, one session end to end

Goal: prove the join that both halves of the measurement depend on, on real
data, before building anything on top of it.

Deliverables:

- A read-only tool that takes one host session transcript plus the telemetry for
  that session and produces the joined record: per semidx call, what it returned
  and what the session spent around it.
- The load-bearing rule stated and applied: **was the file the agent read
  afterwards inside the returned selection?** `selected_paths` makes this
  computable today.
- A written report of where the join holds and where it breaks.

Exit criteria:

- One session is joined end to end and the failure modes are named.
- The re-query ambiguity `ideas/016` measured — the most common follow-up — is
  either separated or explicitly recorded as unresolved. It must not be scored
  as a miss by default.
- No verdict is emitted. `trace_verdict_policy_v1` may only be written after
  this stage shows what the data supports.

Stop condition: if the join does not hold on real data, stop and report. The
rest of the idea rests on it.

Commit boundary: the offline tool and its report; no runtime change.

Status: **complete (2026-09-06)**, report in
[`reports/027`](../reports/027_session_telemetry_offline_join.md). The join holds
mechanically — the selection, the host token split, and the follow-up commands
are all recoverable from real transcripts. What does not hold is the verdict
rule on top: `ideas/016` never bounds "what the agent did next", and between two
retrievals there are 0 to 429 tool calls, so the distribution moves with an
attribution window nobody has justified. A session reads as a miss or not
depending on that number. The sample available at the time was far too small to
settle it, so `trace_verdict_policy_v1` now has two named prerequisites: a
window with a basis, and sessions to test it on. Re-query stays explicitly
unresolved and is never scored as a miss. The database half is implemented and
tested but not yet exercisable on real paired data, because the host that
produced these transcripts ran without the sink enabled.

### Stage 3. Provider summary — owned by `plans/018`

Recorded here for coordination only. The provider state, facts, gaps, conflicts,
latency, and reason codes belong to the provider pipeline and are Stage 6a work
in [`plans/018`](./018_semantic_provider_authority_migration_plan.md). This plan
is a **consumer**: once that summary exists, it becomes payload on the same
events, needing no new transport.

Deliberately not started here, so one owner keeps the provider contract.

## Verification

Per stage, narrowest first:

- `clojure -M:test` for any code change;
- `./scripts/validate-contracts.sh` if any recorded shape changes;
- for Stage 0, evidence is the inventory report, not a passing test;
- PostgreSQL work follows `RULES.md`: check for a running instance, restart
  cleanly, then run.

## Risks

### [High] Recording numbers semidx did not measure

Mitigation: cost, cache splits, and prices enter only through the offline join,
never as runtime event fields.

### [High] A verdict rule invented after looking at the data

Mitigation: `trace_verdict_policy_v1` is written and versioned before any
scoring, and Stage 2 explicitly produces no verdict. The five questions it is
blocked on are listed under "Blockers before `trace_verdict_policy_v1`"; two of
them — who declares a task and who authors the verdict — decide whether the
resulting number is a measurement or a self-report.

### [Medium] Thin volume

`ideas/016` measured 72 semidx calls across 15 sessions. That is not a dataset,
and any pacing expectation should be set before anyone waits on a number.

### [Medium] Privacy

Mitigation: the Stage 0 inventory answers what is written; anything carrying
prompt text or source code by default is a finding, not a feature.

## Blockers before `trace_verdict_policy_v1`

Five questions. Three are now answered (2026-09-06) by taking observable
boundaries instead of inventing them; two remain open. None may be settled by
picking whichever answer makes the numbers look better; that is the failure the
[High] risk above already names. Until the remaining two are answered, this
track keeps accumulating raw events and computes no task-level metric.

### 1. What one task is — answered operationally (2026-09-06)

**The unit of attribution is the user turn**: one real user prompt to the next.

Not chosen for convenience. Automatic segmentation of a query stream into tasks
is still an open research problem in information retrieval, where the data is
orders of magnitude larger than ours; on ten retrievals it is hopeless. So the
boundary is taken rather than inferred, and the turn is the only boundary in the
stream that is both observable and **not drawn by the agent**. It is separable
in practice: one real session had 37 user prompts against 481 tool-result
records and 6 meta records.

`task_id` is kept as the **declared semantic label** on top, because one task
often spans several turns of clarification and only the agent knows that. The
two are not alternatives:

| level | boundary | source | agent controls it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| session | MCP session | server | no |
| turn | user prompt to user prompt | transcript | **no** |
| task | declaration | `set_task_context` | yes |
| retrieval episode | `selection_id` | reference | no |
| request | tool call | `request_id` | no |

Divergence between the observed turn and the declared task is itself a signal —
three declared tasks inside one turn, or one task spanning ten turns, both say
something — rather than a reason to distrust the data.

### 2. Who may declare a task boundary — resolved by not depending on it

The denominator is now the turn, which the agent does not draw, so the conflict
of interest is out of the metric. `task_id` remains agent-declared and remains
useful, but nothing is counted on it alone.

If a future metric does depend on the declared label, it is a self-reported
measure and must be presented as one.

### 3. Who authors the verdict

Separate from the boundary, and the first of the two gaps `ideas/016` left open.
Behaviour is not agreement: a read of a file from the selection can mean "found
it" or "started double-checking", and the transcript cannot tell them apart. A
human judgement after the fact, a wrapper, and the agent itself are three
different measurements, not three implementations of one.

### 4. The attribution window — answered (2026-09-06)

Split in two, because it was one question standing for two different things.

**Staged continuation needs no window at all.** `expand_context` and
`fetch_context_detail` carry the `selection_id` the retrieval returned, so they
link to it by reference the way a span links to its parent. Stage 2 originally
swept them into the same heuristic window as everything else, which over-counted
them: a fixed window of 5 reported two staged continuations in a session that
had one, because the window reached into a neighbouring retrieval.

**Everything else is attributed to the end of the turn.** Not another arbitrary
number: the retrieval was made in service of that request, and work after the
next user prompt answers a different one.

Measured effect on the four real sessions — calls attributed per retrieval:

| | unbounded (to next retrieval) | turn boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| range | 0 to 453 | 4 to 81 |

`boundary-comparison` keeps the fixed-window figures alongside as evidence for
the choice, not as a knob: at window 1 a session shows no out-of-selection read
at all, at window 10 it shows two, and that sensitivity is exactly why an
arbitrary number could not be used.

### 5. Volume

Corrected 2026-09-06. Stage 2 first reported ten retrievals across four
sessions; that counted only this repository. Across all projects the transcripts
hold **144 semidx calls in 35 sessions**, and nothing had rotated away as that
report claimed.

Still a sample rather than a dataset, but the starting point is larger and it
grows on its own now that recording is on: one global MCP server serves every
project, so telemetry covers all of them and `root_path_hash` separates them.

One caveat that matters more than the count: **the bias is global, not local.**
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` mandates semidx-first in every project, and the project
`CLAUDE.md` files do not mention semidx at all — so all 144 calls are
instruction-following and there is no sample of unprompted choice anywhere.
Observational data can show how semidx performs when used; it cannot show
whether an agent would choose it, nor whether it beats the alternative. Those
need withholding (`ideas/016`) or a comparative arm (`plans/020`).

This blocker resolves by waiting rather than by deciding — but the waiting
period should be stated before anyone looks at a number.

### What is safe to do meanwhile

Keep collecting raw events. Their value does not depend on how a task is later
defined: `session_id`, `latency_ms`, `confidence_level`, `estimated_tokens`, and
the transcript join stay correct under any of these answers. A metric computed
on a prematurely chosen boundary does not — and once a number exists, it tends
to set the frame it was supposed to test.

## Owner decisions (2026-09-05)

All four questions below were settled before Stage 0 ran.

1. **Task boundary is declared, never inferred.** `session_id` is the whole
   interactive session, `task_id` is one user goal or attempt inside it, and
   `request_id` is one MCP tool call. The host or a session wrapper supplies the
   task id; an event without one is written as ungrouped. No runtime inference
   from text.
2. **`SPEC.md` §5.1 is not rewritten.** Observability yields admission and
   evidence, not a value verdict; the comparative North Star stands and
   `plans/020` remains the path to a real verdict.
3. **Collection starts with the interactive MCP surfaces only** — stdio and
   Streamable HTTP. Library, HTTP, and gRPC are connected later, and only if
   Stage 0 shows the event shape and privacy are sound.
4. **The paused `plans/020` artefacts stay** as the fallback comparative path.

## Stage 0 result (2026-09-05)

Complete. Full inventory in
[`reports/026`](../reports/026_passive_session_telemetry_stage0_inventory.md).
Four findings, one already fixed:

- **The MCP HTTP transport recorded nothing** (fixed): it built no sink, and an
  absent sink is indistinguishable from a quiet session. Now wired and tested.
- **`resolve_context` loses the session id** (High, open): the query's `trace`
  *overwrites* the server session id instead of refining it, so a client that
  sends no trace leaves the field null on exactly the operation that matters,
  while its neighbours carry the server id. Events do not group today.
- **The selection is not on the event payload** (High, open): `selected_paths`
  and `selected_unit_ids` exist on the library path but not on the MCP tool
  event, so Stage 2's load-bearing rule is not computable from the database
  alone. It remains computable from the host transcript, which retains the full
  MCP result per call — Stage 2 is written against that shape.
- **The raw intent text is recorded by default** (Medium, open): source code is
  never recorded, but `normalized_query_summary.details` stores the user's query
  verbatim. Against the stated "no full prompt by default" constraint this needs
  an owner decision — hash, truncate, or opt-in — before collection widens.

Stage 1 therefore starts with the session-id defect, not with `task_id`:
supplying a task id on top of an inconsistent session id would group events
inside a session that does not group.
