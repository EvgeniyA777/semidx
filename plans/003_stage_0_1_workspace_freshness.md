# Implementation Plan: Stage 0+1 — Contract Baselines and Workspace Freshness

Status: Active
Architecture reference:
  plans/architecture/004_semidx_extension_architecture_resolution_plan.md

## Goal

Fix the P0 correctness defect: `create_index` must never return a stale snapshot
when repository files have changed. All entry surfaces (MCP, HTTP, gRPC, library)
must share a single freshness decision — not each implement their own.

**Root problem:** `tool-create-index` in `mcp.core` computes a cache key from
`(root-path, paths, parser-opts, language-policy)` — no file content is
included. A file can change between two identical `create_index` calls and the
second returns a stale snapshot. Similarly, `runtime.index/create-index` checks
storage reuse only by snapshot age (`stale?`), not content. Both are correctness
defects.

## Scope

In:
- Contract baseline tests (Stage 0)
- WorkspaceState capture and diff (Stage 1)
- FreshnessPolicy (Stage 1)
- IndexLifecycleCoordinator (Stage 1)
- Workspace manifest embedded in snapshot payload (Stage 1)
- Atomic snapshot publication via existing project-registry lock (Stage 1)
- Additive lifecycle outcomes and diagnostics in MCP/HTTP/gRPC responses (Stage 1)

Out (next stages):
- Provider catalog and registry
- Discovery separation from language activation
- Typed relations / Reference model
- Markdown or YAML indexing

## New Files

### `src/semidx/runtime/workspace_state.clj`

Responsibility: capture a content-addressed manifest of all indexable files.

Key functions:

```clojure
(defn capture-workspace-state
  [root-path discovery-profile provider-catalog-version]
  ;; Returns WorkspaceState map)

(defn diff-workspace-state
  [previous current]
  ;; Returns {:added_paths [...] :changed_paths [...] :deleted_paths [...]
  ;;          :unchanged_paths [...] :compatibility_changes [...]})
```

WorkspaceState shape:

```clojure
{:schema_version            "1"
 :root_path                 "..."
 :discovery_profile_hash    "..."    ; hash of discovery inputs (.gitignore, paths, etc.)
 :provider_registry_version "1"     ; bumped when parser output changes
 :semantic_pipeline_version "1"     ; bumped when index schema changes
 :files
   [{:path            "src/foo.clj"
     :content_digest  "sha256:..."  ; SHA-256 hex — primary correctness signal
     :size_bytes      1234
     :modified_at     "2026-06-09T10:00:00Z"  ; acceleration hint only
     :provider_id     "clojure-native"
     :provider_version "1"
     :classification  "source"}]
 :workspace_fingerprint "sha256:..."}  ; digest of sorted file list + all versions
```

Rules:
- `modified_at` + `size_bytes` are used only to skip hashing unmodified files.
- `content_digest` is the authoritative identity.
- A cache hit is valid only when `workspace_fingerprint` matches.
- Sort file list by path before computing `workspace_fingerprint` for determinism.
- Use `java.security.MessageDigest` (SHA-256) for all hashing.
- Walk `root-path` via existing `adapters/source-files` until discovery is
  separated in Stage 3.
- `provider_registry_version` and `semantic_pipeline_version` are constants in
  this namespace; bump them in the same commit as any breaking change to parser
  output or index schema.

### `src/semidx/runtime/freshness.clj`

Responsibility: pure function — decide reuse, incremental update, or rebuild.

```clojure
(defn decide-freshness
  [previous-snapshot current-workspace-state opts]
  ;; Returns:
  ;; {:action         :reuse | :incremental_update | :full_rebuild
  ;;  :reason         "..."
  ;;  :changed_paths  [...]
  ;;  :deleted_paths  [...]
  ;;  :diagnostics    [...]})
```

Decision rules (in priority order):

1. `force_rebuild` in opts → `:full_rebuild "force_rebuild_requested"`
2. No previous snapshot → `:full_rebuild "initial_build"`
3. `:workspace_state` missing from previous snapshot → `:full_rebuild "no_prior_manifest"`
4. Manifest schema version incompatible → `:full_rebuild "manifest_schema_incompatible"`
5. `provider_registry_version` or `semantic_pipeline_version` changed →
   `:full_rebuild "provider_or_pipeline_version_changed"`
6. `workspace_fingerprint` matches → `:reuse "workspace_unchanged"`
7. Delta file count > threshold (default 50% of total) →
   `:full_rebuild "delta_exceeds_threshold"`
8. Otherwise → `:incremental_update` with `changed_paths` and `deleted_paths`

Zero side effects. Independently testable with plain maps.

### `src/semidx/runtime/index_lifecycle.clj`

Responsibility: orchestrate capture → freshness → build/update → persist →
publish. Used by all entry surfaces.

```clojure
(defn coordinate-index-lifecycle
  [{:keys [root-path parser-opts storage load-latest force-rebuild
           pinned-snapshot-id language-policy max-snapshot-age-seconds
           rebuild-reason repo-identity-reuse-mode]}]
  ;; Returns same index map as current create-index, plus
  ;; additive :index_lifecycle outcome fields.
```

Sequence:

1. Capture `current-workspace-state` via `workspace-state/capture-workspace-state`.
2. Load prior snapshot from storage (same logic as current `maybe-load-index`).
3. Call `freshness/decide-freshness`.
4. Dispatch on action:
   - `:reuse` → return prior snapshot with lifecycle outcome attached.
   - `:incremental_update` → call existing `runtime.index/update-index` with
     computed `changed_paths`; handle `deleted_paths` via `remove-paths-from-index`.
   - `:full_rebuild` → call existing `runtime.index` full-parse path.
5. Embed `current-workspace-state` into snapshot payload as additive
   `:workspace_state` field.
6. Persist via `storage/save-index!` if storage is configured.
7. Publish under the existing project-registry refresh lock.

The coordinator does NOT touch MCP JSON, HTTP status codes, or transport fields.

## Modified Files

### `src/semidx/runtime/index.clj`

- `create-index` delegates to `index-lifecycle/coordinate-index-lifecycle` for
  the full reuse/update/build decision.
- Internal helpers (`parse-files`, `build-index-state`, `maybe-load-index`,
  `maybe-save-index!`) remain and are called by the lifecycle coordinator.
- `build-index-state` accepts an optional `:workspace_state` arg and stores it
  in the snapshot map (additive, no schema break for existing callers).

### `src/semidx/mcp/core.clj`

- `tool-create-index`: in-memory cache-key atom is retained for `index_id`
  lookup, but freshness correctness is delegated to the lifecycle coordinator.
  `find-cached-entry` is no longer the source of truth for reuse.
- `index-summary` gains three additive fields:

  ```clojure
  :lifecycle_action      "reuse" | "incremental_update" | "full_rebuild"
  :lifecycle_reason      "..."
  :lifecycle_diagnostics [...]
  ```

  Existing `cache_hit` field is preserved and set `true` only for `:reuse`.

### `src/semidx/runtime/storage.clj`

- `save-index!` (both `InMemoryStorage` and `PostgresStorage`) persists
  `:workspace_state` as part of the snapshot payload. For Postgres, stored in
  the existing `payload` JSONB column — additive, backward-compatible.
- `load-latest-index` and `load-index-by-snapshot` return `:workspace_state`
  when present; `nil` for legacy snapshots (triggers full rebuild).

### `src/semidx/core.clj`

No logic changes. `create-index` already delegates to `idx/create-index` and
transparently receives the richer lifecycle result.

### `src/semidx/runtime/http.clj`, `src/semidx/runtime/grpc.clj`

Additive lifecycle outcome fields passed through to response serialization.

## Implementation Sequence

Seven small commits, each independently testable.

### Commit 1 — Contract baseline tests (Stage 0)

New: `test/semidx/freshness_baseline_test.clj`

Protected cases that must stay green through all subsequent commits:
- `create-index` on unchanged repo returns same `snapshot_id` (reuse).
- `create-index` after modifying file content returns new `snapshot_id`.
- `create-index` after adding a file includes the new file in the index.
- `create-index` after deleting a file excludes it from the index.
- `update-index` result is semantically equivalent to `create-index` full
  rebuild on the same repo state.
- `force_rebuild: true` always rebuilds regardless of workspace state.

These tests initially FAIL — they are the acceptance gate for Commits 4–6.

### Commit 2 — `workspace_state.clj` + unit tests

New: `src/semidx/runtime/workspace_state.clj`
New: `test/semidx/workspace_state_test.clj`

Test matrix:
- Identical filesystem state → identical `workspace_fingerprint`.
- Modified content → file in `:changed_paths`, different fingerprint.
- Added file → file in `:added_paths`.
- Deleted file → file in `:deleted_paths`.
- `modified_at` change, content unchanged → NOT in `:changed_paths`.
- `size_bytes` change without content change → hash decides (not changed).
- `provider_registry_version` bump → appears in `:compatibility_changes`.

### Commit 3 — `freshness.clj` + unit tests

New: `src/semidx/runtime/freshness.clj`
New: `test/semidx/freshness_test.clj`

Tests cover all eight decision rules with plain Clojure maps — no I/O.

### Commit 4 — `index_lifecycle.clj` wired into `runtime.index`

New: `src/semidx/runtime/index_lifecycle.clj`
Modified: `src/semidx/runtime/index.clj`

- `create-index` calls `coordinate-index-lifecycle`.
- Snapshot payload includes `:workspace_state` on fresh build.
- In-memory mode after restart → no prior manifest → honest full rebuild.
- All existing `runtime_test.clj` tests must remain green.
- Commit 1 baseline tests that were failing should now pass.

### Commit 5 — Storage additive field

Modified: `src/semidx/runtime/storage.clj`

- `save-index!` persists `:workspace_state`.
- `load-latest-index` returns `:workspace_state` when present.
- Existing `storage_test.clj` tests must remain green.
- New tests: `InMemoryStorage` workspace-state round-trip.

### Commit 6 — MCP transport additive fields + cache-key fix

Modified: `src/semidx/mcp/core.clj`

- `tool-create-index` delegates freshness to lifecycle coordinator.
- `index-summary` returns `lifecycle_action`, `lifecycle_reason`,
  `lifecycle_diagnostics`.
- Existing `mcp_server_test.clj` and `mcp_http_server_test.clj` must pass.
- New MCP test: stale cache does not survive file content change.

### Commit 7 — HTTP and gRPC additive fields

Modified: `src/semidx/runtime/http.clj`, `src/semidx/runtime/grpc.clj`

Same additive lifecycle outcome fields. Existing transport tests must pass.

## Acceptance Gates

All must pass before Stage 1 is considered complete:

1. Unchanged repository → `:reuse`, `files_reindexed: 0`.
2. Modified file content → `:incremental_update` or `:full_rebuild`, never `:reuse`.
3. Added file included in new snapshot.
4. Deleted file excluded from new snapshot.
5. `provider_registry_version` bump → `:full_rebuild`.
6. Incompatible manifest schema → `:full_rebuild`.
7. Failed state capture → never a cache hit (throws or returns error, not reuse).
8. In-memory mode after process restart → honest `:full_rebuild`.
9. Persisted snapshot validated before reuse (missing `workspace_state` → rebuild).
10. Incremental update result semantically equivalent to full rebuild on same state.
11. `force_rebuild: true` → always `:full_rebuild`.
12. Artificial failure during update leaves previous snapshot active.
13. Two concurrent `create_index` on same root → no corrupted or partial snapshot.

## Verification

```bash
# Run full test suite
clojure -M:test

# Run only new tests
clojure -M:test :only semidx.workspace-state-test
clojure -M:test :only semidx.freshness-test
clojure -M:test :only semidx.freshness-baseline-test
```

MCP smoke test sequence:

```
1. Start MCP server
2. create_index on this repo                   → lifecycle_action: "full_rebuild"
3. create_index again, no changes              → lifecycle_action: "reuse"
4. Touch src/semidx/core.clj (append newline)
5. create_index again                          → lifecycle_action: "incremental_update"
6. Revert the touch
7. create_index again                          → lifecycle_action: "reuse"
```
