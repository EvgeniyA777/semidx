# Consensus Analysis of Reviewer Comments

Synthesis of three independent reviews (codex, antigravity, claude) of
`plans/008_stage_0_1_workspace_freshness.md`. Where a claim was checkable against
the code, it was verified and the verification status is recorded — not taken on
the reviewer's word.

Shared verdict across all three: the plan is directionally strong (correct P0
target, correct decomposition), but the runtime contracts must be tightened
before implementation. All three ran `clojure -M:test` → 189 tests, 0 failures.

## 1. Consensus findings (raised by 2+ reviewers)

| ID | Topic | Raised by | Verified | Substance |
|----|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| A | Private helpers / deleted-path boundary | codex, antigravity, claude | ✅ `remove-paths-from-index` is `defn-` at `index.clj:659`; 5 helpers private | A coordinator in a separate namespace cannot reach the private index helpers; deletion routing is undefined. |
| B | mtime/size acceleration underspecified | codex, antigravity, claude | ✅ signature at plan L55-57 lacks prior state | Three facets of one hole — see below. |
| C | Freshness identity wider than fingerprint | codex (H2); adjacent claude/antigravity | plan only checks `workspace_fingerprint` | Reuse must also key on `paths`, `parser_opts`, `language_policy`, discovery profile, subset scope. |
| D | `cache_hit` false when action ≠ reuse | codex (gate), claude (M7) | — | Behavioral change vs current `cache_hit`; document it. |
| E | Atomic publication / concurrency | codex (H5), claude (H2) | — | Lock granularity undefined; lost-update / TOCTOU risk; needs CAS on fingerprint; no test for gate #13. |
| F | Source of provider/pipeline versions | codex (H1), claude (M5) | — | codex: provider catalog is out of scope yet versions are in the manifest → need a temporary deterministic source. claude: manual bump is error-prone without a CI guard. Complementary. |

### Detail on B — the three reviewers pull in different directions
The plan must pick a stance; today it has none, which is why all three flagged it.
- **antigravity (perf, concrete bug):** `capture-workspace-state
  [root-path discovery-profile provider-catalog-version]` does not receive the
  prior manifest, so it cannot compare mtime/size and must hash every file on
  every call. This is the root cause.
- **claude (correctness):** even with a prior manifest, skipping on
  `mtime + size` leaves a hole — a content change that preserves both mtime and
  size yields a false reuse, contradicting the "never stale" goal.
- **codex:** needs an exact algorithm (when a digest may be reused, timestamp
  resolution, clock skew).

→ Fork: **correctness (always hash) vs performance (skip with prior state and an
explicitly accepted Make-level trade-off)**. Resolve and rewrite the "never
stale" wording accordingly.

## 2. High-value unique findings

- **antigravity A-H1 — `added_paths` are never routed. ✅ VERIFIED, high impact.**
  Plan rule 8 (L122) and the dispatcher (L147-148) handle only `changed_paths`
  and `deleted_paths`; `added_paths` from `diff-workspace-state` (L61) go
  nowhere. New files are never parsed on an incremental run → fails acceptance
  gate #3 and, consequently, gate #10. Neither codex nor claude caught this.
  Fix is trivial: `(concat changed_paths added_paths)` into the `update-index`
  call.
- **codex — contract gaps:** pinned-snapshot semantics; incomplete lifecycle
  output schema (`files_reindexed` undefined); unresolved nested `:index_lifecycle`
  vs flat `lifecycle_*` fields; vague HTTP/gRPC contract (needs concrete
  request/response examples); no manifest-size performance guard.
- **claude — double persistence:** `update-index` already calls
  `maybe-save-index!` (`index.clj:694`), while coordinator step 6 persists again →
  overlapping ownership. Plus the arbitrary 50% delta threshold (rule 7).

## 3. Findings that did not hold up (honesty)

- **antigravity A-MH2 (in-memory cache loss in stdio) — premise is incorrect.**
  The claim "in stdio `storage-adapter` is `nil` → always `:full_rebuild`" does
  not hold: `new-session-state` (`mcp/core.clj:1159-1160`) defaults
  `:storage_adapter` to `(or storage-adapter (storage/in-memory-storage))` —
  **never nil**. Within a session the in-memory storage retains the snapshot and
  `load-latest-index` finds it. Across process restarts it is empty, which is an
  honest `:full_rebuild` (gate #8). The valid adjacent concern (how the session
  `cache-key->index-id` atom and storage-based freshness interact) survives via
  codex C-H3, but the specific "always rebuild" mechanism is false.
- **claude self-correction:** the "gate #10 is architecturally supported" note
  (because `update-index` rebuilds the full graph) holds **only if** the input is
  changed **+ added + deleted**. A-H1 exposes the missing precondition, so the
  guarantee is conditional, not unconditional.

## 4. Forks that cannot be resolved silently

1. **Coordinator placement:** separate `index_lifecycle.clj` (plan) vs. embed in
   `index.clj` to preserve encapsulation (antigravity) vs. extend `update-index`
   with a small internal API (codex). Recommended hybrid: keep the coordinator
   inside/next to `index.clj` **and** widen `update-index` to
   `{:changed_paths :added_paths :deleted_paths}` — this closes A and A-H1 at once.
2. **Hashing:** correctness (always hash) vs. performance (skip with prior state).

## 5. Consolidated remediation priority

1. **A-H1** (`added_paths`) and **B** (capture signature + correctness/perf
   stance) — they break the stated P0 correctness and gates #3/#10.
2. **A** (private boundaries), **F** (version source), **E** (publication /
   concurrency) — concrete implementation gaps.
3. **C**, **D**, double persistence, lifecycle output schema, pinned snapshots —
   contract precision.
4. Thresholds, metadata, performance guards — polish.
