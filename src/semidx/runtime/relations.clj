(defn traverse-relations
  "Pure bounded traversal over relation indexes. `indexes` is any map carrying
  :relations, :relation_forward_index, and :relation_reverse_index (index-relations
  output or a snapshot). `request` keys:

  - :direction        :downstream | :upstream (required)
  - :start_nodes      seq of source unit ids (required, non-blank)
  - :relation_types   allow-list set/seq; empty means all types
  - :resolved_only    default true (ambiguous/unresolved edges are skipped)
  - :max_depth / :max_nodes / :max_discovery_paths  clamped to default-traversal-bounds

  Returns {:direction :start_nodes :relation_types :budgets :nodes :edges
  :discovery_paths :truncated}. Traversal is breadth-first and cycle-safe (a node is
  discovered once, at its shortest depth), and output ordering is deterministic
  regardless of underlying set iteration order. Implemented on top of
  `traverse-relations-with` with an in-memory batched frontier provider."
