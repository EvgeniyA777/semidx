(ns semidx.runtime.provider-execution
  "Stage 2 provider execution orchestrator (plans/018).

  Executes a ProviderPlan with bounded concurrency, per-provider timeouts,
  failure isolation, gap tracking, and diagnostics, and emits one `FactBatch`
  per provider for `semidx.runtime.fact-arbitration`.

  It knows how to run providers and how to report what happened. It does not
  decide authority, merge semantics, retrieval confidence, or transport shapes.

  Everything here is shadow work: it never writes to the active snapshot and
  never changes what `adapters/parse-file` returns."
