  "Stage 4.5 of the Semantic Provider Authority Migration (plans/018, ADR-046):
  the project-scoped provider execution boundary. On the default path since
  Stage 6 made `:authority` the default mode.

  A SCIP provider indexes a project once and then yields facts for the documents
  that run covered. That is a different execution shape from
  `semidx.runtime.provider-execution`, which runs one provider against one file,
  so it gets its own boundary rather than a mode flag on the per-file one.

  This namespace is also the only place that reaches for both SCIP adapters.
  They read indexer output through generated protobuf classes, and keeping that
  dependency here is what lets `semidx.runtime.providers` and
  `semidx.runtime.provider-selection` — the per-file planning path — stay free
  of it. The adapters are resolved on first use rather than required at the top,
  so a deployment whose protobuf classes are not built reports an unavailable
  provider instead of failing to load the seam.

  What it does:

  1. observes project provider status through each adapter's own probe;
  2. plans admitted providers with `provider-selection/project-plan`, which uses
     the same admission and exclusion rules as the per-file plan;
  3. runs each admitted provider exactly once, isolating failures, and skips a
     run whose negative result is still fresh (Stage 6c,
     `semidx.runtime.provider-negative-cache`);
  4. reports coverage in one document-state vocabulary for every language;
  5. hands the resulting facts to per-file execution through the injected
     `run-provider` role, so a project provider's evidence reaches arbitration
     on the same path as every other tier.

  What it does not do: change default extraction, write a snapshot, decide
  authority, or branch on a language. Nothing here runs unless a caller asks for
  it, and a provider is planned only when its status was actually observed."
