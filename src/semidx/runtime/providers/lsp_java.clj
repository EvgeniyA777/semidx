  "Stage 5b of the Semantic Provider Authority Migration (plans/018, ADR-046):
  the Java live-overlay provider. Opt-in, shadow, default-off.

  A second consumer of the Stage 5a seam, which it uses unchanged:
  `semidx.runtime.provider-overlay` still owns the session lifecycle, source
  identity, the failure taxonomy, coverage, and delivery. What lives here is
  only how jdtls is resolved and started, and how its symbols become facts.

  Four properties of the real server shape this adapter, all verified against
  jdtls 1.54.0 over the protected corpus rather than assumed:

  - **it needs a JDK 21 or newer**, independent of the JDK semidx itself runs
    on. Under 17 the OSGi framework refuses to resolve
    `org.eclipse.jdt.core.manipulation` and the application never registers, so
    the JVM is resolved and version-checked separately;
  - **members arrive late and their absence is silent**: right after `didOpen`,
    `documentSymbol` returns the package and the class with no children and no
    error, so this adapter polls for readiness and treats exhaustion as a
    degradation rather than publishing the early answer;
  - **overload identity stays arity-only**: symbols are named `handle(String)`,
    `handle(String, int)`, `OrderService(Validator)`. Arity is recoverable, but
    the parameter types are simple names — the exact form Stage 4 rejected as
    Variant B for `scip-java`. Types remain evidence, never key material;
  - **references are unavailable** in this mode: without a build file jdtls runs
    an invisible project with no resolved classpath, and
    `textDocument/references` comes back empty even for a method the corpus
    calls twice. The descriptor claims `definitions` only.

  Unlike the TypeScript server, jdtls needs a writable `-configuration`
  directory and a `-data` workspace directory outside the repository, and picks
  a per-platform `config_*` directory. None of that reaches the seam."
