(ns semidx.runtime.providers.scip-shadow-compare
  "Shadow comparison of the SCIP exact tier against the Stage 2 tree-sitter /
  regex tier, plus latency and fact-set size measurement.

  Read-only. Runs both shadow producers over a corpus, never writes a snapshot,
  and changes no default extraction. Its purpose is to record — before the
  Stage 6 authority switch — that:

  - a symbol both tiers find lands on the *same* `canonical_fact_key_id`, so
    SCIP exact evidence merges onto the existing unit identity instead of
    minting a duplicate (Stage 3 exit criterion);
  - what SCIP adds (exact-only symbols) and what it does not model
    (legacy-only symbols) is explicit and expected, not a silent regression;
  - the per-fact evidence expansion and SCIP run latency are measured
    (plans/018 [Medium] snapshot-size and latency risks).

  Two entry points. `shadow-report` is the Stage 3 TypeScript harness: it drives
  the TypeScript adapter directly. `project-shadow-report` is the Stage 4.5
  form: it runs the project seam in `semidx.runtime.provider-batch` for every
  admitted project provider, then splits the two tiers back out of the per-file
  runs that merged them. The second is language-neutral and is the shape the
  Stage 6 admission evidence is recorded in.

  On a host without a tree-sitter grammar the legacy tier is regex only; the
  comparison is identical in shape."
