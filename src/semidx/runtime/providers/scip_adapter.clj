  "Shared boundary for the SCIP provider adapters (plans/018 Stages 3 and 4,
  ADR-046).

  Everything a SCIP adapter does that is not language-specific lives here:
  toolchain path resolution helpers, the per-document stale gate that anchors
  exact authority, `FactBatch` assembly, the arity-only overload guard, and the
  `ready` / `unavailable` / `failed` result shapes.

  The plan's Stage 4 exit criterion is that no TypeScript-specific rule enters
  this boundary. What stays in a language adapter is only: how its toolchain is
  resolved and invoked, and which `semidx.runtime.providers.scip-normalize`
  bridge it uses.

  Nothing here writes to a snapshot or changes default extraction."

  `fact-arbitration/arbitrate-facts` splits a core-key group only when it holds

  `arity_only` — scip-java, which disambiguates overloads with a source-order

  A group is ambiguous when two or more of its definition facts are arity-only
