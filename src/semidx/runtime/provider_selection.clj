    provider run (Stage 4.5). A project provider becomes a candidate for this
    file only where a run actually covered it.
  - `:observed_statuses` — statuses for providers the catalog cannot probe
    itself: project batch indexers and language servers, observed by the
    boundary that owns their lifecycle. They are merged only for candidates
    where `providers/locally-probed?` is false, so an externally supplied status
    can never override a real tree-sitter or regex probe. Without one such a
    candidate is excluded as `provider_status_unknown`, exactly like any

  are what this function produced before the provider tiers were added, so the
