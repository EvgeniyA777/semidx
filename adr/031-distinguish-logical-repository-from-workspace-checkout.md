summary: Model repository identity with a logical repo key plus workspace-specific checkout metadata instead of treating root_path as the only identity dimension.

# ADR-031: Distinguish Logical Repository From Workspace Checkout

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-04-03  
**Deciders**: project owner

## Context

`semidx` currently uses `root_path` as the main practical identity key for both in-memory runtime coordination and persistent snapshot storage.

This works well for a single checkout of a repository on one machine.

It becomes insufficient when the same git repository exists in multiple clones or worktrees because:

- the same logical project appears as several unrelated roots
- snapshot reuse cannot distinguish project identity from checkout identity
- branch and commit metadata become disconnected from project-level history

The new decision is not about transport APIs or retrieval behavior. It is about the identity model that snapshot metadata should carry from this point forward.

## Decision Drivers

- preserve current behavior for existing callers
- support several clones or worktrees of the same repository
- keep branch and commit metadata observable but secondary
- avoid making branch names or root paths the only durable identity key
- keep implementation small enough for staged rollout

## Considered Options

### Option 1. Keep `root_path` as the only identity key

Continue treating each checkout path as a separate repository identity.

### Option 2. Add a logical repository key alongside workspace checkout identity

Model one logical repository plus one or more workspace checkouts and keep `root_path` as compatibility metadata.

### Option 3. Use branch name as the primary repository identity

Treat each branch as a top-level repository identity boundary.

## Decision

We accept Option 2: add a logical repository key alongside workspace checkout identity.

After this decision:

- a snapshot may describe one logical repository and one concrete checkout at the same time
- `repo_key` identifies the logical repository
- `workspace_path` and `workspace_key` identify the concrete checkout
- `git_branch`, `git_commit`, and `git_dirty` are snapshot metadata, not identity roots
- `root_path` remains present for backward compatibility and current callers

Option 1 loses because it keeps multi-clone support fundamentally impossible without higher-level heuristics.

Option 3 loses because branch names are unstable and are not reliable repository identity keys.

## Consequences

### Positive

- snapshots from several clones of the same repository can be related safely
- branch and commit metadata can be used for filtering and reuse without becoming the primary key
- current `root_path`-based code can continue to work during rollout

### Negative

- snapshot metadata becomes richer and more complex than the current single-key model
- identity derivation must handle no-remote and detached-head cases
- storage and tests must be extended to cover the new dimensions

### Follow-Up

- add a repo identity derivation module
- attach repo identity metadata to snapshots
- persist additive identity metadata in storage
- keep public APIs backward-compatible during the first rollout

## Status

Accepted and implemented through the multi-clone repository identity rollout.

## Definition Of Done

This decision is fully implemented when:

1. New snapshots contain `repo_key`, `workspace_path`, and `workspace_key`.
2. Git metadata is attached as additive snapshot metadata.
3. Existing `root_path`-based callers still work without request changes.
